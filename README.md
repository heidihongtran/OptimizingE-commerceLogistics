# Project: Optimizing E-commerce Logistics
This is a group work in my post-graduate program.

The goal of this assignment is to collect supply chain-related data and build models to help a company better practice understanding, efficiency, and effectiveness. That can be achieved by enabling data-driven decisions at strategic, operational, and tactical levels. 

Analytics can directly contribute to the Supply Chain processes. We chose this dataset to analyze and optimize the shipment status.
